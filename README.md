# NDP Framework

The goal of this project is to create a framework by which I can explore Near Data Processing (NDP) algorithms and, eventually, estimate the performance of an NDP-based appliance.

The baseline is to have Python objects for the NDP storage nodes and different Python objects for the interconnect between the nodes.
